Action Replay/Commlink
-----------------------
-Almost done, just a few odd commmands that haven't been implemented

CD Block
---------
-Setup cdfs/newlib connections

Backup Ram
-----------
-Nothing has been done here

DRAM Cart
----------
-Nothing has been done here

Netlink
--------
-Add it to cvs, finish writing it so people can actually do something with it

SCSP
-----
-Aside from loading the sound driver, nothing else has been done here

SMPC
-----
-Need to rework intback so code is tighter
-Only standard pad, keyboard and mouse support have been added.

SCU DSP
--------
-Might need a few minor things, but otherwise complete

System link
------------
-I have some code for it, needs to be written so there's less lost data

VDP1
-----
-Might need some reworking, but otherwise complete

VDP2
-----
-Need to better detect vram cycles
-Pretty much everything except for Rotation Screens, Back Screen and color offset
 needs implementing

Features
---------
-Fullscale Debugger
-gdb stub
-Redo vdp code so that as little actual rendering is done during a v-blank as
 possible(only dma to vram, peripheral retrieving, etc. should be done)

Misc
-----
-Clean up the rest of code, make to easier to use, and then merge it
-It'd be more efficient to use tables in vdp vram cycle calculations as the
 code required do to all that work may end up taking more space than a table
 would
-Optimize CD code better to fit the average programmer(I mean, they probably
 won't even use like half of what the cd block has to offer)
