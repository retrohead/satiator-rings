# Dear translators:
# Thank you for translating Nova! :)
# 
# Instructions:
#
# 1. Use "en_US.ini" as a template and create your "xx_XX.ini" file with your language code
#    as the file name. Here to find a list of language codes:
#    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3191664/list-of-all-locales-and-their-short-codes
#
# 2. Sharp (#) in a .ini file means a comment, which is not the actual translation contents,
#    it's just as its literal meaning.
#
# 3. The LEFT side of an equal sign is a key that Nova uses to identify a string.
#
# 4. Ampersand (&) on the RIGHT side of an equal sign means it's a keyboard hotkey, when you
#    press ALT, the letter after (&) will be underlined. And when you press ALT + (the letter underlined),
#    the corresponding menu item will be selected. i.e when you presse ALT + F, the File menu will be
#    opened. Take an example (French translation): Help = &Help  >>>  Help = &Aide
#
# 5. Please make sure your file is saved in UTF-8 without BOM.
#    Recommended text editor: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
#    How to make settings on UTF-8 wihtout BOM:
#    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7256049/how-do-i-convert-an-ansi-encoded-file-to-utf-8-with-notepad
#
# 6. This instruction doesn't need to be included in your language file.
#
# 7. Finally, happy translating! :)
#
# Best regards,
# Steve
